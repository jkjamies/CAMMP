<!-- Plugin description -->
**CAMMP (Clean Architecture Multi-Module Plugin)** is a powerful Android Studio plugin designed to accelerate modern Android development by automating the creation of Clean Architecture components.

It provides a suite of generators to scaffold boilerplate code, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices:

*   **Clean Architecture Generator**: Instantly scaffolds a full feature module structure (domain, data, di, presentation, dataSource) with proper Gradle configurations and dependency wiring.
*   **Repository Generator**: Creates repository interfaces (Domain) and implementations (Data), including optional data sources (Remote/Local) and Dependency Injection (Hilt or Koin) modules.
*   **Use Case Generator**: Generates Use Case classes in the Domain layer, automatically injecting required repositories and setting up DI bindings.
*   **Presentation Generator**: Scaffolds UI components including ViewModels, Screens (Compose), UI State, Intents (MVI), and Navigation destinations, with support for both MVI and MVVM patterns.

CAMMP supports both **Hilt** and **Koin** (including Koin Annotations) for Dependency Injection, making it versatile for various project setups.
<!-- Plugin description end -->

**IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template** is a repository that provides a pure template to make it easier to create a new plugin project (check the [Creating a repository from a template][gh:template] article).

The main goal of this template is to speed up the setup phase of plugin development for both new and experienced developers by preconfiguring the project scaffold and CI, linking to the proper documentation pages, and keeping everything organized.

## Testing

[Testing plugins][docs:testing-plugins] is an essential part of the plugin development to make sure that everything works as expected between IDE releases and plugin refactorings.
The IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template project provides integration of two testing approaches – functional and UI tests.

### Functional tests

Most of the IntelliJ Platform codebase tests are model-level, run in a headless environment using an actual IDE instance.
The tests usually test a feature as a whole rather than individual functions that comprise its implementation, like in unit tests.

In `src/test/kotlin`, you will find a basic `MyPluginTest` test that utilizes `BasePlatformTestCase` and runs a few checks against the XML files to indicate an example operation of creating files on the fly or reading them from `src/test/testData/rename` test resources.

> [!NOTE]
> Run your tests using predefined *Run Tests* configuration or by invoking the `./gradlew check` Gradle task.

## Predefined Run/Debug configurations

Within the default project structure, there is a `.run` directory provided containing predefined *Run/Debug configurations* that expose corresponding Gradle tasks:

![Run/Debug configurations][file:run-debug-configurations.png]

| Configuration name | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Run Plugin         | Runs [`:runIde`][gh:intellij-platform-gradle-plugin-runIde] IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin task. Use the *Debug* icon for plugin debugging.              |
| Run Tests          | Runs [`:test`][gradle:lifecycle-tasks] Gradle task.                                                                                                       |
| Run Verifications  | Runs [`:verifyPlugin`][gh:intellij-platform-gradle-plugin-verifyPlugin] IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin task to check the plugin compatibility against the specified IntelliJ IDEs. |

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the logs from the running task in the `idea.log` tab.
>
> ![Run/Debug configuration logs][file:run-logs.png]

## Continuous integration

Continuous integration depends on [GitHub Actions][gh:actions], a set of workflows that make it possible to automate your testing and release process.
Thanks to such automation, you can delegate the testing and verification phases to the Continuous Integration (CI) and instead focus on development (and writing more tests).

In the `.github/workflows` directory, you can find definitions for the following GitHub Actions workflows:

- [Build](.github/workflows/build.yml)
  - Triggered on `push` and `pull_request` events.
  - Runs the *Gradle Wrapper Validation Action* to verify the wrapper's checksum.
  - Runs the `verifyPlugin` and `test` Gradle tasks.
  - Builds the plugin with the `buildPlugin` Gradle task and provides the artifact for the next jobs in the workflow.
  - Verifies the plugin using the *IntelliJ Plugin Verifier* tool.
  - Prepares a draft release of the GitHub Releases page for manual verification.
- [Release](.github/workflows/release.yml)
  - Triggered on `released` event.
  - Updates `CHANGELOG.md` file with the content provided with the release note.
  - Signs the plugin with a provided certificate before publishing.
  - Publishes the plugin to JetBrains Marketplace using the provided `PUBLISH_TOKEN`.
  - Sets publish channel depending on the plugin version, i.e. `1.0.0-beta` -> `beta` channel.
  - Patches the Changelog and commits.
- [Template Cleanup](.github/workflows/template-cleanup.yml)
  - Triggered once on the `push` event when a new template-based repository has been created.
  - Overrides the scaffold with files from the `.github/template-cleanup` directory.
  - Overrides JetBrains-specific sentences or package names with ones specific to the target repository.
  - Removes redundant files.

All the workflow files have accurate documentation, so it's a good idea to take a look through their sources.

### Dependencies management

This Template project depends on Gradle plugins and external libraries – and during the development, you will add more of them.

All plugins and dependencies used by Gradle are managed with [Gradle version catalog][gradle:version-catalog], which defines versions and coordinates of your dependencies in the [`gradle/libs.versions.toml`][file:libs.versions.toml] file.

> [!NOTE]
> To add a new dependency to the project, in the `dependencies { ... }` block, add:
> 
> ```kotlin
> dependencies {
>   implementation(libs.annotations)
> }
> ```
> 
> and define the dependency in the [`gradle/libs.versions.toml`][file:libs.versions.toml] file as follows:
> ```toml
> [versions]
> annotations = "24.0.1"
> 
> [libraries]
> annotations = { group = "org.jetbrains", name = "annotations", version.ref = "annotations" }
> ```

Keeping the project in good shape and having all the dependencies up-to-date requires time and effort, but it is possible to automate that process using [Dependabot][gh:dependabot].

Dependabot is a bot provided by GitHub to check the build configuration files and review any outdated or insecure dependencies of yours – in case if any update is available, it creates a new pull request providing [the proper change][gh:dependabot-pr].

> [!NOTE]
> Dependabot doesn't yet support checking of the Gradle Wrapper.
> Check the [Gradle Releases][gradle:releases] page and update your `gradle.properties` file with:
> ```properties
> gradleVersion = ...
> ```
> and run
> ```bash
> ./gradlew wrapper
> ```

### Changelog maintenance

When releasing an update, it is essential to let your users know what the new version offers.
The best way to do this is to provide release notes.

The changelog is a curated list that contains information about any new features, fixes, and deprecations.
When they're provided, these lists are available in a few different places:
- the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file,
- the [Releases page][gh:releases],
- the *What's new* section of the JetBrains Marketplace Plugin page,
- and inside the Plugin Manager's item details.

There are many methods for handling the project's changelog.
The one used in the current template project is the [Keep a Changelog][keep-a-changelog] approach.

The [Gradle Changelog Plugin][gh:gradle-changelog-plugin] takes care of propagating information provided within the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) to the [IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin][gh:intellij-platform-gradle-plugin].
You only have to take care of writing down the actual changes in proper sections of the `[Unreleased]` section.

You start with an almost empty changelog:

```
# YourPlugin Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Initial scaffold created from [IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template)
```

Now proceed with providing more entries to the `Added` group, or any other one that suits your change the most (see [How do I make a good changelog?][keep-a-changelog-how] for more details).

When releasing a plugin update, you don't have to care about bumping the `[Unreleased]` header to the upcoming version – it will be handled automatically on the Continuous Integration (CI) after you publish your plugin.
GitHub Actions will swap it and provide you an empty section for the next release so that you can proceed with your development:

```
# YourPlugin Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1]
### Added
- An awesome feature
- Initial scaffold created from [IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template)

### Fixed
- One annoying bug
```

To configure how the Changelog plugin behaves, i.e., to create headers with the release date, see the [Gradle Changelog Plugin][gh:gradle-changelog-plugin] README file.

### Release flow

The release process depends on the workflows already described above.
When your main branch receives a new pull request or a direct push, the [Build](.github/workflows/build.yml) workflow runs multiple tests on your plugin and prepares a draft release.

![Release draft][file:draft-release.png]

The draft release is a working copy of a release, which you can review before publishing.
It includes a predefined title and git tag, the current plugin version, for example, `v0.0.1`.
The changelog is provided automatically using the [gradle-changelog-plugin][gh:gradle-changelog-plugin].
An artifact file is also built with the plugin attached.
Every new Build overrides the previous draft to keep your *Releases* page clean.

When you edit the draft and use the <kbd>Publish release</kbd> button, GitHub will tag your repository with the given version and add a new entry to the Releases tab.
Next, it will notify users who are *watching* the repository, triggering the final [Release](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow.

### Plugin signing

Plugin Signing is a mechanism introduced in the 2021.2 release cycle to increase security in [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) and all of our IntelliJ-based IDEs.

JetBrains Marketplace signing is designed to ensure that plugins aren't modified over the course of the publishing and delivery pipeline.

The current project provides a predefined plugin signing configuration that lets you sign and publish your plugin from the Continuous Integration (CI) and local environments.
All the configuration related to the signing should be provided using [environment variables](#environment-variables).

To find out how to generate signing certificates, check the [Plugin Signing][docs:plugin-signing] section in the IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to encode your secret environment variables using `base64` encoding to avoid issues with multi-line values.

### Publishing the plugin

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to follow all guidelines listed in [Publishing a Plugin][docs:publishing] to follow all recommended and required steps.

Releasing a plugin to [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) is a straightforward operation that uses the `publishPlugin` Gradle task provided by the [intellij-platform-gradle-plugin][gh:intellij-platform-gradle-plugin-docs].
In addition, the [Release](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow automates this process by running the task when a new release appears in the GitHub Releases section.

> [!NOTE]
> Set a suffix to the plugin version to publish it in the custom repository channel, i.e. `v1.0.0-beta` will push your plugin to the `beta` [release channel][docs:release-channel].

The authorization process relies on the `PUBLISH_TOKEN` secret environment variable, specified in the `⚙️ Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` section of your project repository.

You can get that token in your JetBrains Marketplace profile dashboard in the [My Tokens][jb:my-tokens] tab.

> [!WARNING]
> Before using the automated deployment process, it is necessary to manually create a new plugin in JetBrains Marketplace to specify options like the license, repository URL, etc.
> Please follow the [Publishing a Plugin][docs:publishing] instructions.

## FAQ

### How to use Java in my project?

Java language is supported by default along with Kotlin.
Initially, the `/src/main/kotlin` directory is available with minimal examples.
You can still replace it or add the `/src/main/java` directory to start working with Java language instead.

### How to disable *tests* or *build* job using the `[skip ci]` commit message?

Since February 2021, GitHub Actions [support the skip CI feature][github-actions-skip-ci].
If the message contains one of the following strings: `[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[no ci]`, `[skip actions]`, or `[actions skip]` – workflows will not be triggered.

### Why does the draft release no longer contain a built plugin artifact?

All the binaries created with each workflow are still available, but as an output artifact of each run together with tests and Qodana results.
That approach gives more possibilities for testing and debugging pre-releases, for example, in your local environment.
